Questions:

These are the commands I ran in my directory path: /p4_web_optimization/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio

npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-jshint
npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-uglify
npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-concat
npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-imagemin
npm install --save-dev grunt-contrib-cssmin
npm install --save-dev load-grunt-tasks
npm install --save-dev grunt-responsive-images
npm install --save-dev grunt-inline-css
grunt --force


I created a dist folder

I am not sure about the syntax, src and dest directory paths, etc., and all code in my Gruntfile.js

So far I am only working with imagemin

How do I get the cwd to be both views/images AND img ?
How to identify the src and dest?

I managed to optimize the views/images folder to the dist folder:
How do I get the optimized images to be read by the project? Do I set dest to the views/images? Do I manually place them?

Where do I put the minified code in the project?
